# Virtual DataFrame

[Full documentation](https://pprados.github.io/virtual_dataframe/)

## Motivation

With Panda-like dataframe or numby-like array, do you want to create a code, and choose at the end, the framework
to use?  Do you want to be able to choose the best framework after simply performing performance measurements?
This framework unifies multiple Panda-compatible,
to allow the writing of a single code, compatible with all.

Do you want to use different architectures at different times of the year to be "green" and cheaper?
Do you want to use a GPU only for the black-friday?

## Synopsis

With some parameters and Virtual classes, it's possible to write a code, and execute this code:

- With or without multicore
- With or without cluster (multi nodes)
- With or without GPU

To do that, we create some virtual classes, add some methods in others classes, etc.

It's difficult to use a combinaison of framework, with the same classe name, with similare semantic, etc.
For example, if you want to use in the same program, Dask, cudf, pandas, modin, pyspark or pyspark+rapids,
you must manage:

- `pandas.DataFrame`, `pandas,Series`
- `modin.pandas.DataFrame`, `modin.pandas.Series`
- `cudf.DataFrame`, `cudf.Series`
- `dask.DataFrame`, `dask.Series`
- `pyspark.pandas.DataFrame`, `pyspark.pandas.Series`

 We propose to replace all these classes and scenarios, with a *uniform model*,
inspired by [dask](https://www.dask.org/) (the more complex API).
Then, it is possible to write one code, and use it in differents environnements and frameworks.

This project is essentially a back-port of *Dask+Cudf* to others frameworks.
We try to normalize the API of all frameworks.
This project will *weave* your code with the selected framework, at runtime.
